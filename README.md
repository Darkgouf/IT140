This was a program to write a simple text based game with one boss "monster" with room and items need to beat the boss.
Overall the program turn out good with a few areas where I wish it would turn out a little better. 
I hope to keep working on this program with add hp and attack point in a D&D style game play, as well add other enemies as well. 
With what I have learn with C++ plan is to continiue to learn more as well maybe use Unreal engine to make this a full fledge game.
