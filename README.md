This was a program to write a simple text-based game with one boss "monster" with room and items needed to beat the boss.
Overall the program turned out well with a few areas where I wish it would turn out a little better. 
The biggest issue I had with this program was learning how to use the dictionary when writing the room format. 
I hope to keep working on this program by adding hp and attack points in D&D-style gameplay, as well as adding other enemies as well. I have to say my professor gave me a lot of great advice when fixing this issue without giving me an answer
With what I have learned with C++ plan is to continue to learn more as well maybe use Unreal engine to make this a full-fledged game. 
As I learned how to pull all of what I had learned in Python together in one project I learned dictionary as well as the importance of comments while coding.
